# Jason L. West, Sr.

AI Infrastructure Engineer (Production GenAI) - Senior Software & Systems Engineer
Bridging 30 years of architectural discipline with the future of Artificial Intelligence.

## 🚀 About Me

I’m a veteran engineer with over three decades of experience building robust, scalable systems. Today I’m focused on AI Engineering and local, containerized AI ecosystems — combining production-grade architecture with practical, privacy-conscious ML workflows.

- 🔭 Currently working on: the Nebulus stack — a modular, container-first platform for local AI infrastructure and workflow orchestration.
- 💡 Goal: Democratize AI by making advanced models accessible, composable, and usable locally.
- 🌱 Exploring: agentic workflows, local LLM orchestration, vector databases, and reproducible Dockerized AI environments.

## 🏆 Featured Work — The Nebulus Stack

Nebulus is a modular stack that helps run, orchestrate, and compose local AI services and agents. The core projects I’ve been actively working on include:

- Nebulus-Prime — https://github.com/jlwestsr/Nebulus-Prime  
- Nebulus-Edge — https://github.com/jlwestsr/Nebulus-Edge  
- Nebulus-Atom — https://github.com/jlwestsr/Nebulus-Atom  
- Nebulus-Gantry — https://github.com/jlwestsr/Nebulus-Gantry  
- Nebulus-Core — https://github.com/jlwestsr/Nebulus-Core

### What Nebulus provides
- Containerized, reproducible environments for local model runtimes and services  
- Modular components for edge deployments, runtime atoms, orchestration (gantry), and core shared services  
- Tooling for model routing, context sharing, and composable agent workflows

## 🛠 Tech Stack — LLM & Runtime Focused

- Inference Runtimes & Clients
  - TabbyAPI (OpenAI-compatible local inference)
  - ExLlamaV2 models and other ExLlama-based runtimes
  - MLX for Apple Silicon optimized runtimes (Nebulus-Edge)
  - Support for vLLM, Ollama, and other local runners
- Model Management & Routing
  - Model routing strategies (8B models for light tasks, 30B+ for heavy tasks)
  - Model warmup and runtime tuning for low-latency responses
  - Local model download and management tooling
- Retrieval & Memory
  - ChromaDB for vector embeddings and semantic retrieval (conversation LTM, context)
  - NetworkX knowledge graphs for entity-level context enrichment
- Tooling & Extensions
  - MCP server (Model Context Protocol) for tool access: file ops, web scraping, terminal tasks, document parsing
  - SSE streaming support and OpenAI-compatible APIs for conversational streaming
  - Flight recorder telemetry and Streamlit dashboards for monitoring agent behavior
- Deployment & Runtime Considerations
  - Docker & Docker Compose for reproducible local stacks
  - NVIDIA Container Toolkit recommended for GPU-accelerated inference on Linux (Nebulus-Prime)
  - Apple Silicon memory and MLX guidance for Nebulus-Edge
- Integration & Orchestration
  - FastAPI-based LLM service endpoints, httpx OpenAI-compatible clients
  - ChromaDB persistence with volume-backed storage for long-term memory
  - Slack integration (Slack Bolt) for Nebulus Swarm control plane
- Developer Tooling & Quality
  - Python (3.10+ / 3.12 where targeted), TypeScript for frontend
  - pytest for testing, flake8 + black for linting/formatting
  - pre-commit hooks and Conventional Commits / Gitflow-lite practices
