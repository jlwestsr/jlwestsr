# Hi there, I'm Jason L West, Sr. 👋

Software & Systems Engineer | AI Innovator
Bridging 30 years of architectural discipline with the future of Artificial Intelligence.

## 🚀 About Me

I am a veteran engineer with over three decades of experience in software and systems engineering. Throughout my career, I have built robust, scalable systems that stand the test of time.

Currently, I am pivoting my focus to AI Engineering, applying my deep understanding of system architecture to build containerized, local AI ecosystems. I believe the future of AI lies not just in the models, but in the infrastructure that allows them to collaborate and function securely.

* 🔭 I’m currently working on: The-AI – A containerized, general-purpose local AI ecosystem.
* 💡 My goal: To democratize AI by building frameworks that make complex models accessible and composable.
* 🌱 I’m exploring: Advanced Agentic Workflows, Local LLM Orchestration, and Dockerized AI environments.

## 🏆 Featured Project: The-AI

The-AI is more than just a repo; it's a comprehensive AI Collaboration Framework.

> A containerized, general-purpose local AI ecosystem designed to establish a structured environment for AI agents to interact, share context, and execute complex workflows locally.

### Key Technologies:

* Python: Core logic and orchestration.
* Docker: Containerization for reproducible AI environments.
* Local LLMs: Privacy-focused, offline-capable intelligence.
